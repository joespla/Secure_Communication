To run this project you have to run it in two computers and edit some variables in both scripts in both computers:
Computer A: 

client.py
host .- ip from the other computer
port  .- 13007
portTemp 13004

server.py
hostTemp .- ip from the other computer
port .- 13007
portTemp .- 13006


Computer B:

client.py
host .- ip from the other computer
port  .- 13007
portTemp 13006

server.py
hostTemp .- ip from the other computer
